 # Contract Management Platform — Frontend

## 🔍 Project Overview

This is the **frontend application** of a **Contract Management Platform** built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It demonstrates product thinking, clean UI design, state management, and structured architecture — all built from scratch with no UI templates provided.

Users can:
- Create **Blueprints** (reusable contract templates)
- Generate **Contracts** from those blueprints
- Fill values for contract fields
- View contracts in a **Dashboard**
- Track contract status

> This is a frontend-only app; state is stored in React Context and does not persist after refresh.
